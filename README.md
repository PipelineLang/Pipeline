# Pipeline
Pipeline is a simple programming language that entirely revolves around a stack-like structure called *the pipe*. Due to it's simplicity, Pipeline can be transpiled into nearly any programming language and most assembly languages with a minimal compiler. It can also be treated as it's own assembly language and compiled into a binary file. Pipeline is designed to be a minimal high-level programming language that is easy to use by anyone and also feels fimiliar to assembly programmers. This repo is the main code behind Pipeline, and also the Python based interpreter.

## Installation and Usage
For now, there is no official way to install Pipeline. You can run it using python3 with the command:
```sh
python3 ./src # Interactive mode

python3 ./src ./path/to/file.pll # Normal mode
```
